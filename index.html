    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      My name is David Calderon and as you can see I am an expert at HTML and CSS! (Just kidding.) In all honesty, I am just a beginner and I have a long way to go before I am able to really apply these skills in a full time job in this field.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this is what I really want to do for a living! I want to feel like I have accomplished something at the end of the day. So I intend to learn as much as possible in this class and push myself as much as I can.
